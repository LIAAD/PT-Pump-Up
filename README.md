# PT-Pump-Up

PT-Pump-Up is a comprehensive hub designed to centralize Portuguese Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources. Our goal is to provide a one-stop access point for the most relevant tools, datasets, models, and utilities dedicated to advancing NLP within the Portuguese language landscape.

## Software Modules

PT-Pump-Up is structured around four key software modules, each serving a distinct purpose within the ecosystem (See Figure 1.):

### 1. Website in Laravel with Frontend in React

The core interface of PT-Pump-Up is a dynamic website developed using Laravel on the backend and a React frontend. This interface serves as the central access point for users to explore and interact with Portuguese NLP resources.

### 2. pt-pump-up-admin Package

The `pt-pump-up-admin` package, available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pt-pump-up-admin/), is a dedicated administrative Python package. It offers functionality to efficiently manage the backend aspects of PT-Pump-Up, all within the Python ecosystem. This package streamlines administrative tasks without the need to leave the Python environment.

```bash
pip install pt-pump-up-admin
```

### 3. pt-pump-up Client Package

The `pt-pump-up` client package, accessible via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pt-pump-up/), is designed to facilitate interaction with indexed resources. One of its notable functionalities is `load_dataset`, simplifying the process of loading and accessing datasets within the PT-Pump-Up framework.

```bash
pip install pt-pump-up
```

### 4. GitHub Repository

This GitHub repository serves as the open-source community hub for Portuguese NLP researchers. It aims to foster collaboration, encourage contributions, and collectively enhance the Portuguese NLP landscape by providing a platform for sharing ideas, code, and resources.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community to enhance any of the four software components within PT-Pump-Up.

### Contribution Opportunities

1. **Frontend Contributions:** While our expertise lies in NLP and IR, we value and encourage frontend contributions. Your expertise in frontend development can greatly benefit our project by improving user experience and interface design.

2. **Enhancement of Software Components:** Contributions to any of the four software components—Website, pt-pump-up-admin, pt-pump-up client package, or the GitHub repository—are highly appreciated. Whether it's fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving existing functionalities, your contributions will enrich the project.

### Contact Us
